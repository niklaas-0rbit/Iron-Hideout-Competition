The theme of this competition are [b][span color="#4dbbff"]OPPOSITES[/span][/b] and we're looking forward to seeing some amazing submissions featuring this concept. Opposites mean opposing themes, ideas, backgrounds, environments...they can be diametrically different or conflicting in nature and they can be more subdued, covert, internal. Try not to limit yourselves by obvious solutions - try to dig deeper.

[span color="#4dbbff"]SUBMISSIONS START[/span] | September 26th 20:00 CEST
[span color="#4dbbff"]SUBMISSIONS END[/span] | October 23rd 20:00 CEST

After the submission period has concluded we will announce the date for the showcase stream and results.

Before creating a submission please carefully read the rules, there have been changes made since the last competition.


✦ [span color="#4dbbff"]TWO SUBMISSION LIMIT[/span] | Contestants are allowed to submit a maximum of two hideouts and they should fit the theme of this competition as closely as possible.
✦ [span color="#4dbbff"]NO MTX[/span] | No MTX bases or decorations are allowed (including stashes, challenge hideout bases and trophies or decorations unlocked with MTX bases which have a limited number of placed objects). Basically, all decorations placed must be unlimited use plus default stashes, map device, masters, lockers and benches.
✦ [span color="#4dbbff"]HIDEOUT SHOWCASE[/span] | Hideouts need to be uploaded to [url=https://hideoutshowcase.com/]Hideout Showcase[/url] with your Path of Exile forum nickname mentioned in Description (this is to confirm the hideout is your own work).
✦ [span color="#4dbbff"]HIDEOUTS HAVE TO BE YOUR OWN WORK[/span] | They also must be safe to showcase (nothing breaking GGG Terms of Service).
✦ [span color="#4dbbff"]NO PREVIOUS COMPETITION ENTRIES ALLOWED[/span] | Hideouts submitted to either Official Hideout competitions by GGG or previous Iron Hideout competitions are not eligible.
✦ [span color="#4dbbff"]PLACE ALL THE MASTERS BEFORE SUBMITTING[/span] | For the purpose of creating weekly showcase videos please make sure you've placed all the masters (feel free to hide them behind decorations) otherwise they might appear in random locations when importing.
✦ [span color="#4dbbff"]USE THE POST TEMPLATE[/span] | When making your post please copy/paste and fill out the template (feel free to format it to your preference).

Submissions breaking any of these rules will be disqualified.

The judges vote based on the general hideout impression, adherence to the chosen theme, clever or innovative building techniques and overall skill. They all cast their votes blindly, without knowing how others have voted. The votes are then tallied by the organizer and the winners announced.


We do not use poll voting because it is easily manipulated/cheated and even when that's not the case such a system would ensure the contestant with the largest community behind them wins, which would be unfair and impossible to sort through. We feel that a jury of skilled and respected peers is a much better option.

Each week the collection of submissions for that week will be recorded by importing hideout files and uploaded in a showcase video. Because of this you do not have to make your own videos unless you wish to do so. The weekly compilations will be linked here.

[span color="#4dbbff"]WEEK 1 ENTRIES[/span] | October 3rd
[span color="#4dbbff"]WEEK 2 ENTRIES[/span] | October 10th
[span color="#4dbbff"]WEEK 3 ENTRIES[/span] | October 17th
[span color="#4dbbff"]WEEK 4 ENTRIES[/span] | October 24th

(If there are very few entries for any given week they might get merged into next week's compilation.)

All weekly videos including the winners video will be posted on r/pathofexile subreddit and shared on hideout discords.

Time and date will be posted here.
