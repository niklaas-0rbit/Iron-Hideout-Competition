Competition started in 17th June. Theme of this competition is [b][span color="#13cda3"]Wonderland[/b][/span]! Your hideout needs to look like a Wonderland. Wonderland would be a place where you are astonished and amazed by every corner. There need to be wow-factors, marvelous sights and just plain wonderfulness. A Wonderland can be in many forms and we’re accepting all of them! Also no percentage limit this time! There are 5 weeks to complete your hideouts, meaning submissions should be made until 22nd July. Then our jury team will do the voting, which will take one or two weeks. Shortly after voting ends, winners and runners-up will be announced here. After the announcement, prizes will be awarded and shipped, which you can see below.

[b]Why Iron Hideout?[/b]
Name and idea are by Pixxelkick. The inspiration for this event is the show Iron Chef. Like the show, entries must follow a specified theme.

Weekly videos will be posted here as they're recorded. gugglehupf will be making these videos by recording hideout files one by one and combining them. This way all hideouts have the same understanding and quality. This also removes the need of submitters to make their own videos. Here are our weekly videos:

■ No challenge-reward hideout bases, MTX hideout bases or MTX hideout decorations are allowed. Meaning hideout bases and decorations 100% should be obtainable in game without spending any currency in the MTX shop. Challenge trophies, old benches from before the master update, rhoa dinners or other exclusive non-MTX decorations cannot be used. 
■ Your hideout must be your own work.
■ Hideouts that placed in Top 5 in GGG's Official Hideout competitions are not eligible. Also hideouts submitted to previous Iron Hideout competitions are not eligible as well. This means in this competition we're accepting hideouts made in the past too, you are also allowed to update them!
■ Your hideout must be safe to showcase(Nothing against Terms of Service of GGG).
■ Hideouts must fit theme of the competition. (details can be read up in the Competition section of this post)
■ Multiple submissions are welcome, limited to maximum 5 submissions per contestant.
■ We're using hideout files to record your submissions and at the moment there's a bug which makes not unlocked/unplaced masters spawn in random locations. Please unlock all masters and hide the ones you don't want to not-visible places like rocks, walls, etc. You can also make your hideout on standard where all masters will be unlocked. Sadly guggelhupf don't have time to confirm places of all masters in each hideout and if you don't unlock and hide the unwanted ones, they will most likely be at random unwanted locations in our videos.
■ Hideouts need to be uploaded to hideoutshowcase.com with the final hideout file of your work. Sharing is part of this competition. [b]Also adding your Path of Exile forum nickname to Description part in Hideoutshowcase link is required.[/b]
