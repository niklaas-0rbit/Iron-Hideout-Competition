Weekly videos will be posted here as they're recorded. gugglehupf will be making these videos by recording hideout files one by one and combining them. This way all hideouts have the same understanding and quality. This also removes the need of submitters to make their own videos. Here are our weekly videos:

Week One: 
Week Two:

■ No MTX hideout bases or decorations are allowed. Meaning hideout bases and decorations %100 should be obtainable in game without spending any currency in the MTX shop. All decorations should come from favor spending(excluding game specific ones like crafting bench, heist locker, etc.). Challenge trophies, old benches from before the master update, rhoa dinners or other exclusive non-MTX decorations cannot be used. Also hideout bases, decorations and pets that cannot be unlocked anymore by normal ways(Like Ritualist's hideout, etc.) are not allowed. This league Robber’s Trench, Unearthed, Haunted, Glacial, Primeval and Enlightened hideouts are not unlockable so they are not allowed as well. These are to create equality amongst competitors. 
■ Your hideout must be your own work.
■ Hideouts that placed in Top 5 in GGG's Official Hideout competitions are not eligible. Also hideouts submitted to previous Iron Hideout competitions are not eligible as well. This means in this competition we're accepting hideouts made in the past too, you are also allowed to update them!
■ Your hideout must be safe to showcase(Nothing against Terms of Service of GGG).
■ Hideouts must fit theme of the competition. This means your hideout needs to look like a Wonderland. A Wonderland can be in many forms and we're accepting all of them!
■ Multiple submissions are welcome, limited to maximum 5 submissions per contestant.
■ We're using hideout files to record your submissions and at the moment there's a bug which makes not unlocked/unplaced masters spawn in random locations. Please unlock all masters and hide the ones you don't want to not-visible places like rocks, walls, etc. You can also make your hideout on standard where all masters will be unlocked. Sadly guggelhupf don't have time to confirm places of all masters in each hideout and if you don't unlock and hide the unwanted ones, they will most likely be at random unwanted locations in our videos.
■ Hideouts need to be uploaded to hideoutshowcase.com with the final hideout file of your work. Sharing is part of this competition. **Also adding your Path of Exile forum nickname to Description part in Hideoutshowcase link is required.**
■ Using post template below is required. All required is posting your hideout to hideoutshowcase.com and linking it here, putting an image on top is allowed and lastly answering questions in the template message below. As we will be doing competition videos, there is no need to share a video. But if you like you can make your own video and share.
■ Submissions breaking any of these rules will be disqualified.
