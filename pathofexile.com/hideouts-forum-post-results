While visiting Tinys Wonder of the World Fair and watching the Core of the Earth shown there, our minds slowly drifted away and we left the realm of the consciousness.
In doing so, we did land somewhere dark and deep below the surface of a strange planet, where even the Rocks seem to watch and react to your presence. Glowing and dancing lights where you look, we can only WONDER how to LAND back on the pleasant, happy and sunny area of the Wonders of the World Fair again.

First Officer's Log, supplement to Captain's Log, latest entry: The Captain has been rendered comatose like the previous crew during the latest outburst from the energy structures and flora. We have terminated our attempts to restart the generation core directly, rerouted the inputs to power storage arrays, and throttled the connections to hopefully avoid any further incapacitating bursts. This will also unfortunately extend our stay another week, increasing the likelihood we find out what is making the troubling sound from beyond the trees...

The most farthest land. It is a primitive world surrounded by greenery. A space without malice. They say that deep in the dark forest there is a blue flower of purity.

Completely isolated mapping observatory. Its existence has been confirmed at least 2000 years ago. The observer monitors the ground with technology from a defunct old civilization. He is immortal.

THE ANCIENT ONE IS A TREE OLDER THAN TIME OR PERHAPS IT IS CREATION ITSELF.
BEWARE TRAVELERS WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THE ANCIENT'S REALM .

If you find yourself in the Ancient's realm, lay down and slumber beneath its roots.
When you awaken you may see paths stand open that were closed before, where those deemed worthy may find strange puzzles with mystical rewards.

Eternal life, untold riches, mastery of space and time, unbound knowledge, everlasting bliss. Or perhaps nothing - or worst of all, swift and effective judgment.

Sometimes a portal will open before you to lead you back home or take you deeper into the Ancient's grove ...Or teleport you several paces off the path into nothingness of space as the Ancient quietly observes you frantically gasp for air.

Sometimes you will find yourself well rested back in your own bed not remembering a thing. Sometimes the roots will swallow you whole.

For my last entry I went for a hideout that tries to capture the essence, the source, the heart, or however else you want to call it, of nature - in all of its wonder.

It's got the magical feel of the night elven wilds. Plus, what's more wondrous than making memories with friends in MMO starting areas?

The plummeting temperatures make this an ideal place for these mysterious creatures to lay their eggs. An alien wonderland if you'd like to say, either way better steer clear.

Visit the spooky noises emitting and
glowing Oak Tree in the "Biergarten" or its mysterious sparkling brother in the cozy frontyard mapping area.
On top of this you can lay down next to good old haunting catarina if you dare to rent her room.
And if you are more down to earth, you will find a complete tavern and inn with everything you could desire. Wonderful ales and beer from all over the wraeclast, the famous vorici is chief of barbecue so all will get sliced well - and calling for einhar - he can serve you things, you dont want to see alive again. That will be a juicy one, Exile! Don´t say i did not warn you.

Here's how voting was done: Each jury voted for their top 10 hideouts. 1st got 10 points and 10th got 1 point in descending order. Then all juries' points were summed up and winners and runners up were decided. Same method was done for both categories. Votings were blind voting, meaning each jury didn’t know what others voted until the announcement post here.
